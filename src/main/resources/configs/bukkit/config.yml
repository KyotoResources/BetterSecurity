# Function of the executors:
#
# - [MESSAGE] text                                         | (Func. Send a chat message) | (Example: [MESSAGE] &aHello World!)
#
# - [MINI_MESSAGE] mini format message                     | (Func. Send a chat message with the MiniMessage format)
#                                                          | (Tip. To use this format read this page: https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/index.html)
#                                                          | (Example: [MINI_MESSAGE] <green>Hello World!)
#
# - [TITLE] title;subtitle;fade-in;stay;fade-out           | (Func. Submit a title)
#                                                          | (Tip. If you enter "none" in the title or subtitle, it will not be displayed)
#                                                          | (Example: [TITLE] &a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20)
#
# - [ACTION] text                                          | (Func. Send a message in the action bar) | (Example: [ACTION] &aHello World!)
#
# - [BOSSBAR] title;color;style;progress;times             | (Func. Send a message in the boss bar. Compatible with versions 1.9+ only)
#                                                          | (Example: [BOSSBAR] &aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5)
#
# - [SOUND] sound;acute;volume                             | (Func. Send a sound) | (Example: [SOUND] BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1)
#
# - [PLAYER] command without '/'                           | (Func. Send a command as a player) | (Example: [PLAYER] spawn)
#
# - [CONSOLE] command without '/'                          | (Func. Send a command from the console) | (Example: [CONSOLE] give %player% DIAMOND 1)
#
# If you put an "@" in front of the text, it will broadcast the execution.
# Works for the following performers: [MESSAGE], [TITLE], [ACTION], [BOSSBAR], [SOUND]
# Examples: [MESSAGE] @&aHello World! | [TITLE] @&a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20
# | [ACTION] @&aHello World! | [BOSSBAR] @&aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5 | [SOUND] @BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1
#
# If you don't want to do anything, just put "[]" after "executors:"
# Example: executors: []
#
# You can use the following placeholders in all executors:
# - %player% | (Name of the player who attempted to execute the command)
# - %command% | (The command that was blocked)
# - %unknown_command% | (The spigot.yml unknown command message will be displayed)
# - %center% | (You can center text, only works with messages)

Port_Bypass_Prevention:

  # --------- < ? > ---------
  # If your spigot is on the same machine as the proxy, this feature will not be needed!
  # This is because you can set the IP of the spigot to 127.0.0.1,
  # and change it also in the proxy (only the target of the spigot server, if you put this ip in the proxy it will not allow any user to enter).
  # The ip 127.0.0.1 is a private ip, it means that it will be read only by the machine.
  # In this way it will be impossible for everyone to be able to enter through the port,
  # only the proxy will be able to connect, and let users in.
  #
  # If you use the proxy on a machine other than the spigot, the use of this features is recommended to increase your security!
  # I also recommend that you block the port and make it accessible only through the proxy, see this guide:

  # If you set 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 it could be bypassable. So this feature would be useless!

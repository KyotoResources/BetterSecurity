# Function of the executors:
#
# - [MESSAGE] text                                         | (Func. Send a chat message) | (Example: [MESSAGE] &aHello World!)
#

# - [MINI_MESSAGE] mini format message                     | (Func. Send a chat message with the MiniMessage format)
#                                                          | (Tip. To use this format read this page: https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/index.html)
#                                                          | (Example: [MINI_MESSAGE] <green>Hello World!)
#
# - [TITLE] title;subtitle;fade-in;stay;fade-out           | (Func. Submit a title)
#                                                          | (Tip. If you enter "none" in the title or subtitle, it will not be displayed)
#                                                          | (Example: [TITLE] &a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;1;2;1)
#
# - [ACTION] text                                          | (Func. Send a message in the action bar) | (Example: [ACTION] &aHello World!)
#
# - [PLAYER] command without '/'                           | (Func. Send a command as a player) | (Example: [PLAYER] spawn)
#
# - [CONSOLE] command without '/'                          | (Func. Send a command from the console) | (Example: [CONSOLE] give %player% DIAMOND 1)
#
# - [KICK] reason                                          | (Func. Kick the player for a reason) | (Example: [KICK] &cYou got kicked, because you don't have cookies.)
#
# If you put an "@" in front of the text, it will broadcast the execution.
# Works for the following performers: [MESSAGE], [TITLE], [ACTION], [BOSSBAR], [SOUND]
# Examples: [MESSAGE] @&aHello World! | [TITLE] @&a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20
# | [ACTION] @&aHello World! | [BOSSBAR] @&aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5 | [SOUND] @BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1
#
# If you don't want to do anything, just put "[]" after "executors:"
# Example: executors: []
#
# You can use the following placeholders in all executors:
# - %prefix% | (Plugin prefix: Settings > Prefix)
# - %player% | (Name of the player who attempted to execute the command)
# - %server% | (Server name)
# - %command% | (The command that was blocked)
# - %center% | (You can center text, only works with messages)

# Description: The bungeecord has a vulnerability that concerns the commands!
#              In fact, there is no command limiter inside. And what does this entail?
#              that there are clients capable of executing commands quickly up to bringing down the proxy.
#              If activated, this feature allows you to limit the execution of commands,
#              and prevent your network from going offline.
Command_Spam_Limiter:

  # This feature allows you to fix an exploit that crashes your proxy!
  # You can customize it as you like according to your needs.
  enabled: true

  # If it is on "true" the execution attempt warning will be sent to chat.
  warning: true

  # This option determines how often you can run the command (In seconds)
  delay: 3

  # This function determines how many commands based on the delay, the player is punished.
  # (If set to 0, this function will be ignored)
  command_limit: 10

  # If this is set to "true", you will not be able to execute the command during the cooldown.
  block_command: false

  # (If you have set the command limit, along with the kick, this section will be ignored.
  # You can also ignore it by simply putting -> message: '')
  # This message will be shown during a cooldown.

  # You can use the following placeholders:
  # - %seconds% | (Seconds left)
  # - %commands% | (Number of commands executed)
  # < ? > You can find more information about the executors in the header.

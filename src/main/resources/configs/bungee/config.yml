#
# If you put an "@" in front of the text, it will broadcast the execution.
# Works for the following performers: [MESSAGE], [TITLE], [ACTION], [BOSSBAR], [SOUND]
# Examples: [MESSAGE] @&aHello World! | [TITLE] @&a&lHELLO WORLD;&a&l┃ &aThis is a fantastic world!;20;40;20
# | [ACTION] @&aHello World! | [BOSSBAR] @&aHello World!;GREEN;SEGMENTED_20;1.0;5 | [SOUND] @BLOCK_LAVA_POP;0;1
#
# If you don't want to do anything, just put "[]" after "executors:"
# Example: executors: []
#
# You can use the following placeholders in all executors:
# - %prefix% | (Plugin prefix: Settings > Prefix)
# - %player% | (Name of the player who attempted to execute the command)
# - %server% | (Server name)
# - %command% | (The command that was blocked)
